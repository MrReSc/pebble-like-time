# Pebble Like Time

A watchface for Pebble Time 2 (Emery, 200 × 228) with a white clock area,
Workout-yellow status panels and dotted separators.

This watchface was developed with the assistance of coding AI.

- Automatic 12/24-hour time and locale-aware date.
- Battery percentage beside a battery icon that fills with the charge level.
- Pebble Health steps and heart rate when available.
- Sunrise and sunset calculated locally on the paired phone with SunCalc 1.9.0.
- Unavailable status rows disappear; the clock recenters automatically.

The clock updates once per minute. There is no configuration page.

## Build and install

Requires the Pebble SDK and CLI; verified with SDK 4.33.1 and CLI 5.0.40.
No npm dependencies are needed. The optional skill submodule is not required
for the build.

```sh
pebble build
pebble install --emulator emery
pebble install --phone <IP_ADDRESS>
```

Output: `build/pebble-like-time.pbw`. Other Pebble models are not supported.

## Sun times and privacy

The phone calculates sun times locally, normally once per day. Today's stored
result prevents further requests. Missing results are retried at six-hour clock
boundaries after at least six hours; a new day starts a fresh attempt.

The app makes no web requests and does not store or transmit coordinates to a
web service. The phone's location provider may use GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular
services. Health data stays on the watch. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

Sun times use the phone's local time zone, including daylight saving; phone and
watch should use the same time zone. A location change may not be reflected
until the next day. Terrain, observer height and current weather are not
modeled. If either sun event is unavailable, both times are hidden.

## Publication

Use the PBW from `build/`, screenshots and icons in `store-assets/`, and the text in
[STORE_LISTING.md](STORE_LISTING.md). Supply public privacy and support links
in the store entry. The build includes full licenses and notices in the PBW.
