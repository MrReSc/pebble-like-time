# Privacy

Last updated: 5 September 2026

Pebble Like Time does not use accounts, analytics, advertising, or a server
operated by the watchface developer.

## Data handled on the watch

The watchface reads the current battery level and, when the device supports
Pebble Health, daily step count and current heart rate. These values remain on
the watch and are not sent to the paired phone or any network service.

The watch persists the date and the most recently received sunrise and sunset
times, plus the timestamp of the last request attempt for retry control. No
Health history or coordinates are stored by the watchface. Uninstalling the
watchface removes its app-specific storage through PebbleOS.

## Location and local sun-time calculation

When sun times need refreshing, the companion JavaScript asks the paired phone
for its current latitude and longitude. The bundled SunCalc library uses those
coordinates locally on the phone to calculate sunrise and sunset. The
watchface does not store the coordinates and does not send them to the
developer or to any external web service.

The phone's operating-system location provider may use GPS, nearby Wi-Fi
networks, cellular services, or services operated by the platform vendor. Such
processing is controlled by the phone operating system and its location
settings, not by the watchface.

The app accepts a cached location up to six hours old, requests no high-accuracy
fix, and sets a 15-second timeout. Only calculated times and their date are sent
to the watch. The companion logs delivery status and error codes for debugging;
it does not log coordinates or Health values. It makes no HTTP requests.

With a valid result stored for the current date, the watchface does not request
location again that day. If location is unavailable, it retries no sooner than
six hours later while today's sun times remain missing. A new calendar day
starts a new attempt independently of the retry interval.

If location access is denied or unavailable, the watchface continues to work
and simply omits sunrise and sunset.
